While most marches require participants to follow a fixed route and register the distance in advance, participants of the Bernese Distance March have the freedom to choose their route individually.

This flexible structure not only presents a physical challenge but also adds an extra task in navigation and orientation in the terrain.",

It was founded by two officers and members of the Bern section of the SVMLT (Swiss Association of Master Technical Troops), Heinz Krähenbühl and Walter Bürki, who are considered the founding fathers of this traditional event.",
        "paragraph2": "The idea emerged from practical concerns: due to petrol rationing measures at the time, not every Swiss household owned a car. The founders had the innovative idea that the general meeting location of the Bern Section could be reached by all members on foot from home while simultaneously being combined with a military competition.",
        "paragraph3": "This gave rise to the Berner Distanzmarsch, a tradition that has continued and evolved for over six decades, becoming an important part of Swiss military and cultural heritage."

        "paragraph2": "In the 1980s, the march gained an international dimension when a delegation of reservists from the Saarland in Germany participated. This resulted in a deep comradeship and friendship between the Saarland Reservist Association and the Bern Section of the SVMLT, formalized in a sponsorship agreement.",
        "paragraph3": "A significant change came when the distance march was separated from the general meeting, breaking with a long-standing tradition. This decision was made because many members who completed the march stayed away from the meeting to rest, while those who persevered often fell asleep during proceedings.",
        "paragraph4": "Throughout its history, the Bernese Distance March has faced challenges and periods of uncertainty. During a critical time when voices called for abandoning the tradition, Hptm Ruedi Lehmann fought for its continuation.",
